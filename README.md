# ActiveRecord Cloud Spanner Adapter

[Google Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner) adapter for ActiveRecord.

![rubocop](https://github.com/googleapis/ruby-spanner-activerecord/workflows/rubocop/badge.svg)

This project provides a Cloud Spanner adapter for ActiveRecord. It has the __Preview__ release status and supports the following versions:

- ActiveRecord 6.0.x with Ruby 2.6 and 2.7.
- ActiveRecord 6.1.x with Ruby 2.6 and higher.

Known limitations are listed in the [Limitations](#limitations) section.
Please report any problems that you might encounter by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/googleapis/ruby-spanner-activerecord/issues/new).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'activerecord-spanner-adapter'
```

If you would like to use latest adapter version from github then specify

```ruby
gem 'activerecord-spanner-adapter', :git => 'git@github.com:googleapis/ruby-spanner-activerecord.git'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

### Database Connection
In Rails application `config/database.yml`, make the change as the following:

```
development:
  adapter: "spanner"
  project: "<google project name>"
  instance: "<google instance name>"
  credentials: "<google credentails file path>"
  database: "app-dev"
```

## Examples
To get started with Rails, read the tutorial under [examples/rails/README.md](examples/rails/README.md).

You can also find a list of short self-contained code examples that show how
to use ActiveRecord with Cloud Spanner under the directory [examples/snippets](examples/snippets). Each example is directly runnable without the need to setup a Cloud Spanner
database, as all samples will automatically start a Cloud Spanner emulator in a Docker container and execute the sample
code against that emulator. All samples can be executed by navigating to the sample directory on your local machine and
then executing the command `bundle exec rake run`. Example:

```bash
cd ruby-spanner-activerecord/examples/snippets/quickstart
bundle exec rake run
```

__NOTE__: You do need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your local system to run these examples.

Some noteworthy examples in the snippets directory:
- [quickstart](examples/snippets/quickstart): A simple application that shows how to create and query a simple database containing two tables.
- [migrations](examples/snippets/migrations): Shows a best-practice for executing migrations on Cloud Spanner.
- [read-write-transactions](examples/snippets/read-write-transactions): Shows how to execute transactions on Cloud Spanner.
- [read-only-transactions](examples/snippets/read-only-transactions): Shows how to execute read-only transactions on Cloud Spanner.
- [bulk-insert](examples/snippets/bulk-insert): Shows the best way to insert a large number of new records.
- [mutations](examples/snippets/mutations): Shows how you can use [mutations instead of DML](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/dml-versus-mutations)
  for inserting, updating and deleting data in a Cloud Spanner database. Mutations can have a significant performance
  advantage compared to DML statements, but do not allow read-your-writes semantics during a transaction.
- [interleaved-tables](examples/snippets/interleaved-tables): Shows how to create and work with a hierarchy of `INTERLEAVED IN` tables.
- [array-data-type](examples/snippets/array-data-type): Shows how to work with `ARRAY` data types.

## Limitations

Limitation|Comment|Resolution
---|---|---
Lack of DEFAULT for columns [change_column_default](https://apidock.com/rails/v5.2.3/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements/change_column_default)|Cloud Spanner does not support DEFAULT values for columns. The use of default must be enforced in your controller logic| Always set a value in your model or controller logic.
Lack of sequential and auto-assigned IDs|Cloud Spanner doesn't autogenerate IDs and this integration instead creates UUID4 to avoid [hotspotting](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/schema-design#uuid_primary_key) so you SHOULD NOT rely on IDs being sorted| UUID4s are automatically generated for primary keys.
Table without Primary Key| Cloud Spanner support does not support tables without a primary key.| Always define a primary key for your table.
Table names CANNOT have spaces within them whether back-ticked or not|Cloud Spanner DOES NOT support tables with spaces in them for example `Entity ID`|Ensure that your table names don't contain spaces.
Table names CANNOT have punctuation marks and MUST contain valid UTF-8|Cloud Spanner DOES NOT support punctuation marks e.g. periods ".", question marks "?" in table names|Ensure that your table names don't contain punctuation marks.
Index with fields length [add_index](https://apidock.com/rails/v5.2.3/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements/add_index)|Cloud Spanner does not support index with fields length | Ensure that your database definition does not include index definitions with field lengths.
Interleaved tables have composite primary keys| ActiveRecord uses single-column primary keys. Interleaved tables in Cloud Spanner always have multiple columns in the primary key, as a child table always includes the primary key columns of the parent table. You can use interleaved tables with the Spanner ActiveRecord provider. The provider will however only use the child column of the primary key to access individual records, which can cause full table scans.| Define a unique secondary index on the child primary key column.
