## Tests

### Functional tests
We have functional tests for individual components that can be run by
```shell
bundle exec rake test
```

### ActiveRecord integration tests
We run full integration tests with continuous integration on Google Cloud Build with Kokoro.

Command : `bundle exec rake acceptance[project,keyfile,instance]`

Variable|Description|Comment
---|---|---
`project`|The project id of the Google Application credentials being used|For example `appdev-soda-spanner-staging`
`keyfile`|The Google Application Credentials file|For example `~/Downloads/creds.json`
`instance`|The Cloud Spanner instance to use, it MUST exist before running tests| For example
`activerecord_tests`

#### Example
```shell
bundle exec rake acceptance[appdev-soda-spanner-staging,/home/Downloads/creds.json,activerecord_tests]
```

## Coding Style

Please follow the established coding style in the library. The style is is
largely based on [The Ruby Style
Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) with a few exceptions based
on seattle-style:

* Avoid parenthesis when possible, including in method definitions.
* Always use double quotes strings. ([Option
  B](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#strings))

You can check your code against these rules by running Rubocop like so:

```sh
$ cd ruby-spanner-activerecord
$ bundle exec rubocop
```

The rubocop settings depend on [googleapis/ruby-style](https://github.com/googleapis/ruby-style/), in addition to [.rubocop.yml](https://github.com/googleapis/ruby-spanner-activerecord/blob/main/.rubocop.yml).
