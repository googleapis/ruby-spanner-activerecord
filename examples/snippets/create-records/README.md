# Sample - Create Records

This sample shows how to create and save entities using ActiveRecord.

The sample will automatically start a Spanner Emulator in a docker container and execute the sample
against that emulator. The emulator will automatically be stopped when the application finishes.

Run the application with the command

```bash
bundle exec rake run
```
