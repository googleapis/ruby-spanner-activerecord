# Sample - Read/Write transactions

This example shows how to use read/write transactions using the Spanner ActiveRecord adapter.

The sample will automatically start a Spanner Emulator in a docker container and execute the sample
against that emulator. The emulator will automatically be stopped when the application finishes.

Run the application with the command

```bash
bundle exec rake run
```
